## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "Final_Project.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

## **Data**
The data used for the analyses was gathered from a class survey with a total of 121 student responses and 21 variables. The focus of this project was to determine whether there is a relationship between students' levels of engagement and their sense of purpose. Each unit of analysis was one student, and the sampling strategy used was convenience sampling since the data was collected directly from students in the course.

I analyzed the data by importing the dataset into R and calculating descriptive statistics for both Engagement and Purpose, such as the mean, standard deviation, summaries, and frequency tables. I then created a contingency table comparing the two variables and ran a chi-squared test of independence to determine whether Engagement and Purpose were related.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of student engagement was operationalized as a categorical variable named engagement, which represents how involved, interested, or attentive a student feels toward their academic experience. This variable was measured using students’ survey responses, which were then summarized through descriptive statistics and a frequency table. We measured these variables by coding them (Yes=1, No=0).

The concept of purpose was operationalized as a categorical variable named purpose, which represents the degree to which students feel they have direction, meaning, or goals in their lives. This variable was measured using the students’ selected response categories and was summarized using descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, summary values, and a frequency table. We measured these variables by coding them (Yes-1, No=0).

Finally, to evaluate whether engagement and purpose were related, I created a contingency table comparing the two variables and conducted a chi-square test of independence. This allowed me to test whether differences in engagement levels corresponded with differences in purpose levels. The chi-square test did not show a statistically significant relationship between the two variables.
